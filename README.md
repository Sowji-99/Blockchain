# Simple Blockchain-Based Tracking System

## Overview
This project implements a simple blockchain designed for educational purposes, demonstrating the fundamental principles of blockchain technology. The system simulates a basic tracking mechanism where each block records an item's movement through different locations, showcasing the use of blockchain for data integrity in tracking systems.

## Features
- **Genesis Block Creation**: Initializes the blockchain.
- **New Block Addition**: Adds new blocks with tracking data (item ID, location, timestamp).
- **Hashing for Integrity**: Ensures data is tamper-proof with SHA-256 hashing.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Hashlib (SHA-256)
- Object-Oriented Programming

## How to Run
1. Install Python (version 3.7+).
2. Run the `blockchain.py` script.
3. Observe the terminal output for the blockchain creation process.
